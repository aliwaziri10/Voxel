content_provider.py - single shared entry point for all LLM-based content
generation across Voxel. Every script that needs an outline (slide deck),
a manuscript (page-by-page book), or a novel chapter calls into this
module instead of rolling its own HTTP call + JSON parsing.

This is Phase 1 of ARCHITECTURE.md: removing duplicated content-generation
code from make_lesson.py, build_book.py, and generate_images.py.

Phase 8 addendum (one-command publishing pipeline, see HANDOFF.md):
added generate_novel_chapter() and call_raw() for prose-chapter generation
(novels aren't a fixed-field JSON list like picture-book pages), used by
voxel_cli.py and humanizer.py.

Phase 8b addendum: added direct NVIDIA API support as an alternative to
OpenRouter. If NVIDIA_API_KEY is set, it's used (direct NVIDIA NIM
endpoint, no OpenRouter middleman/rate limits). Otherwise falls back to
OPENROUTER_API_KEY exactly as before - existing workflows/notebooks that
only set OPENROUTER_API_KEY keep working unchanged.

Phase 9 addendum: added generate_beat_map(), a chapter-by-chapter outline
generated ONCE up front for a novel, before any prose is written. Fixes
the "loses the plot over 45 chapters" gap - previously each chapter only
got the same top-level brief plus "continue naturally from last chapter",
with nothing tracking where the plot needs to go next. See story_bible.py
for where the beat map is stored and voxel_cli.py cmd_novel for how it's
used.

2026-09-19 fix: generate_novel_chapter() previously never stated a target
word count anywhere in its prompt, which was the root cause of chapters
coming in far under the standing 2000-2300 target (some as low as
825-1093 words - see Book 2/3 PROOFREAD_REPORT.md). Added explicit
min/max word params, stated directly in the system prompt. voxel_cli.py's
cmd_novel also now checks the actual word count after generation and
retries with a stronger instruction if still short - see that file.
