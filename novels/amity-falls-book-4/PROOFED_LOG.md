# Book 4 proofed log

Only what was read from live `main` is stamped. Update this file every time a
chapter is verified. Never stamp from memory or from a handoff claim.

Legend: APPLIED = fix read back from the live chapter. QUEUED = in
`scripts/book4_fixes.json`, not yet in the chapter. SEEN = seen in an earlier
grep, not re-read. NOT PROOFED = no continuity check done.

  violations, 0 em dashes. Advisory flags only. This is NOT a continuity or

  him. She tried to end the bargain." (2 matches).
- 2026-09-21 15:50 UTC: second automated pass, commit `f8551915`. Auto-fixed
